# The SpeedMate Manifesto

I believe that **speed is a basic human right** on the web, not a luxury feature to be rented for $49/year.

1. **No Lite Versions:** The code you see is the full code. No greyed‑out options. No "Upgrade to Unlock".
2. **No Bloat:** I don’t load upsell banners in your dashboard. I don’t track you.
3. **Automation over Configuration:** If a machine can decide the best setting based on data, a human shouldn’t have to guess.
4. **Community Owned:** Built by the community, for the community. Forever MIT.

Install it. Forget it. Watch your site fly. 

The best is yet to come :)
