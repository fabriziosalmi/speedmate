refactor: split StaticCache into 5 specialized classes

StaticCache.php reduced from 598 lines to 213 lines (-64%)

Created 5 new classes with single responsibilities:
- CacheStorage: file operations, size/count, flush
- CacheRules: Apache/Nginx config generation
- CacheTTLManager: TTL calculation by content type
- CacheMetadata: path generation and security validation
- CachePolicy: cacheable determination, exclusions

StaticCache now orchestrator delegating to specialized classes.
All public API maintained for backward compatibility.
Security validations preserved in CacheMetadata.

Issue: #16
Milestone: v0.4.0 Week 1
